That means a free Ukraine and everyone goes his own way making something of their countries instead on this nonsense in 2022. You don't invade and kill your neighbours. Ever. Dot end of the line.
1588844187331756033,Sat Nov 05 10:42:28 +0000 2022,"@VolkerBrandt12 @GeromanAT @ukraine_map I agree with your reading, but the US-backed coup constitutes a violation of Article 1 that predated (indeed motivated) Russia’s violation of 1. Fits larger pattern of US unilateral abrogation, e.g. ABM Treaty &amp; Open Skies, then whining about Russian non-compliance."

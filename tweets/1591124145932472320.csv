I have known this phrase for several months ago

Would USA give Alaska to Russia if Putin solemnly promised to never again act expansionist? Chamberlain became a synonym for appeasement. That did not slow Hitler.

They wanted to spend $50B to protect schools, but D’s and R party loyalists aka RINOs wanted to send it to Ukraine. Who really wants to protect kids? The D party lies to you"

It's literally not our fight. We all saw the footage how Ukrainian treated Africans when the war started. Now this African is getting abused and they even might kill him just for fun. https://t.co/CGKsYbGH3d"

It infers violence and when used in the way you and your far right pals are using it it is the very essence of “hate speech”. Cease and desist FFS.

Drones alleged to have range of 1,800-2,500 km and Avdiivka is less than 1,000 km from northern end of Caspian Sea.

Will USN send gunboats to stop this?"

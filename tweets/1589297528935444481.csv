1589297183064436737,Sun Nov 06 16:42:30 +0000 2022,We can’t simply “stop sending aid to Ukraine.” What we can do is bring the war to a close by pushing for a great power settlement that can free up scarce resources for Asia. We should also probably stop bluffing about dual containment. They can see through it. https://t.co/09KRUTBdO3

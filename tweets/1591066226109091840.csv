1591065905508876289,Fri Nov 11 13:50:47 +0000 2022,@WarMonitor3 Well you thought Ukraine could get there breaking through RU lines which technically didn't happen for the past 5 months. RU overcomplicated things and underestimated the enemy and now is forced to leave the city nut not because of military superiority of the enemy.

Right after the superiour #Russian withdrawal, that is the greatest achievement by Russian forces so far in the war, there is not too many options left for #Zelensky. 
Of course #Ukraine could conquer back some more terrain, but still..... @engpravda 🙂"

1591065887070912513,Fri Nov 11 13:50:42 +0000 2022,@POTUS And you don't run a country on consumer spending. You have ruined the economy for working families and there's no disposable income. Interest rates so high some can't afford to buy the overpriced homes. STOP sending $ to Ukraine and u can't afford to misuse taxpayer's money

Let's make abortion federally in exchange for destruction of our constitution, war,  loss of our wealth, strengthening of China so they can win a war against us, then after all of that the one world government can take over. All of that for abortions."

It ain't copper, but if Consumer demand drops in China, EU &amp;/or US for electro-domestic goods, &amp; EV rollouts slump on recession + chip shortages, it's a bumpy ride. But global policy has set the demand &amp; the long-term trend."

It's not. $TSLA is ensuring that every EV they make in Q4 for China gets delivered in Q4. They're smoothing out deliveries over the entire quarter instead of relying on a December rush. See front-loaded discount in November.

Sure, China has about twice our emissions. We also have almost as much as the next 3 countries after us, and we still have higher per capita emissions than China. You asked what impact we have.  There it is."

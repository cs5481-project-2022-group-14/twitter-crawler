All these states attacked by Ru in the past voluntarily seek NATO protection &amp; now are members. Just guess why is that? Even neutral Finland and Sweeden got scared and joined. UA also wants protection. The biggest treath tu RU is their agressive policy.

Doesn't change the fact that Ukraine will continue to fight until they expel the dictator's invading army. The only question is how many Russians are going to die for Putin before that happens.

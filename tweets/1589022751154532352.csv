1589022323059064832,Sat Nov 05 22:30:19 +0000 2022,@Tendar Ukraine has no need to rush. A methodical crushing approach is very effective in sparing own troops. The new troops will get into the kill box and they will be decimated. Only a matter of time until they will only dream about the golden ticked to home: a non-lethal wound.

Funny you think trickle dow economics is real.

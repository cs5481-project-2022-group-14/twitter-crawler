1590387766898360322,Wed Nov 09 16:56:06 +0000 2022,@visegrad24 Today might be an excellent day for all those @NATO troops doing joint exercises to tell Putin that they’re coming as a peace keeping force in *all* of Ukraine &amp; Russian troops must leave.

1590387755351408640,Wed Nov 09 16:56:03 +0000 2022,@VaushV All I've seen is USA and Ukraine underperforming because of fascists. And it's sad to see tbh.

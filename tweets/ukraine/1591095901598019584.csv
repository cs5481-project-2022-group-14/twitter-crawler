It would be the best strategy for me too, to go down towards Melitopol, in order to attack the enemy from the rear who are on the bank of the Dnieper"
1591095630713466880,Fri Nov 11 15:48:54 +0000 2022,@ashwin_baindur @TheStudyofWar The proof of the pudding lies in its eating. Putin’s military has been exposed as a third-class and ill-equipped force that got a real whipping from west-backed Ukraine. Putin isn’t just defeated but has been humiliated as well. It is a matter of time he will lose Crimea as well.

The reason why they changed stuff was because Gundam was getting a tad stale, focusing on important topics that (before the ukraine war) were no longer that important. So they pivoted to topics that are a lot more 'in the now' while still keeping it a Gundam series"

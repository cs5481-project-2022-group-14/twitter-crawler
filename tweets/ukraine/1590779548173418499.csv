Never watch Fox News again. They support GOP traitors who oppose money for burn pit victims, money for VA hospitals, money for Ukraine…and they supported TFG, a shell of a man who mocked veterans who were POWs. Oorah."

I become more convinced as each day goes by, that there's no way Ukraine are gonna lose this war.
Onwards!"

This retreat is due to the tenacity,  bravery, and sacrifices they have shown and made defending Ukraine.
Also made possible by US, EU, NATO, support!🇺🇦🇺🇸"

Denazification of Ukraine who have been suppressing native Russians. That includes Kherson. Leaving it and taking what they can get is defeat for them. Unless the reasonings for the SMO were overblown. Not good.

The pentagon and intel services are running the country - not civilians."

Why wasn't Ukraine made a NATO member back in 2014-2020? NATO doesn't want Ukraine, or Ukraine would have been a NATO member already.  Russia will get Kherson back after Ukraine goes dark, I don't see NATO wanting Ukraine then."

When small children left without arms and legs?  Or when people die under the rubble of houses destroyed by rockets?!  Or maybe when the russian army destroys civilian infrastructure?

Only Russia is humiliating Russia. 
It’s a false dilemma (trilemma). Russia can end this any time it likes. Russia is the only party that has a difficult decision to make. Ukraine and Western Europe don’t have any further decisions to make after *defend Europe*"

1591129025740611585,Fri Nov 11 18:01:36 +0000 2022,I don’t understand how someone as wrong as often as Milley still fills a critical role in our security apparatus. He has once again gotten in front of the Biden Administration &amp; inadvertently serviced the Putin agenda by adding pressure for Ukraine to deliver concessions.

I’ve could see this. During my Pentagon days, the massive eye rolls from senior leaders attending Tanks were legendary."

I know correlation isn't causation but is there a link between this and their apparent retreat from Kherson?

Seems to have been in Ukraine since about 2018, fighting/shelling DPR/LPR.

Obviously he fights with Right Sector Bde. Grieves his losses about the fallen mercs, this clown is embedded with the Spanish clowsns.

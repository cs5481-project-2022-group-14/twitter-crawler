Why are the Russians choosing to go to Ukraine and kill Ukranians together with their children instead of staying in Russia to fight for better future for their own?

All Ukraine has to do is put a cordon around it. There is no need to destroy the city - their own city - or to take unnecessary casualties in fighting for it.

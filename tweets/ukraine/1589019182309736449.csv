Why two superpowers at war, Taiwan people must join as proxy?
Why can't stay out of the war?
Ukraine people chose to be a proxy since 2014, what about TW people?

The only reason Putin dared to invade Ukraine was because Trump was such a weak leader that did all he could to weaken NATO. Remember when Trump sided with Russia against the FBI https://t.co/0zzuMSa7lK

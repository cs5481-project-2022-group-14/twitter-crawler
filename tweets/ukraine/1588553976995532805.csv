You lost the battles of Kyiv, Karkhiv, Izyum and now Kherson.

1588553651219763202,Fri Nov 04 15:27:59 +0000 2022,German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visit to China is a good step towards peace. Any issues should be resolved by dialogue rather than confrontation. China can use its influence to Russia to end war in Ukraine which solves the problem of financial meltdown at the moment.

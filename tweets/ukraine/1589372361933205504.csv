Only one way forward is possible to stop the invasion which is strengthening Ukraine forces. Russia only fears strength. Ukraine needs better defensive systems against Iranian weapons.

This all by way of saying, the worst of all possible events is war. Bc in war, all the rules you are used to go out the window.

Don't promote war."

But I think you’ve missed the critical point that if Ukraine are aiming to reclaim Crimea, that is tantamount to regime change because there is no way Putin can survive the loss of Crimea. He can possibly survive losing the newly annexed regions with a big spin. Not Crimea."

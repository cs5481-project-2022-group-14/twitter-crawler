Ukraine supporters always claim it was an ""unprovoked"" war.  But the opposite is true. Especially after an unelected regime took power in 2014 in Kiev."
1590296847460900864,Wed Nov 09 10:54:49 +0000 2022,@TheNatlInterest Please cite one occasion where Putin has threatened the Ukraine with the use of nuclear weapons?
1590296844617162752,Wed Nov 09 10:54:48 +0000 2022,"@Podolyak_M Even crisper: Kremlin exhausted. RF's resources close to their limit. Hence RF hysterically requesting a break (""negotiations""), while Patrushev visits Tehran to replenish missile stocks and get drones with which to continue war. Now is the perfect time to double aid to Ukraine."

The only real way to counter Iranian ballistic missiles is to hit the launchers.

Now men can't leave Ukraine with the threat of death penalty while women can.

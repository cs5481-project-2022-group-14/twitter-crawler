I think south will have better weather for offensive operations before the end of the year (drier, less mud). So, Zaporizhia with the rested Kherson forces."

This winter it will be costly to sustain those 10s of thousands of poorly equipped troops and far better that this be Russias problem than Ukraine’s problem.

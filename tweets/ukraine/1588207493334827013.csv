Putin is the one killing many including the soldier’s he sent across the boarder! Ukraine is just defending its country! Disgusting post with false narrative! Your either pro Putin or a bot!

Biden admin slow to start with, Jake Sullivan wobbly at times. Even recently Biden &amp; Zelensky had a little scrap.
